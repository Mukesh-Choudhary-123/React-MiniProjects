# All Project's🚀 made by using *React*❄ 
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative, efficient, and flexible. React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by using a component-based approach.

### Programmatic React features:

* Hooks - Use different React features from your components.
* Components - Documents built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
* APIs - APIs that are useful for defining components.
* Directives - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.
